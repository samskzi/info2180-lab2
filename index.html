             <p class = "p2">Listen hair porosity is the most important thing that a black woman can learn about. Once
              you learn the porosity of you hair, you'll suddenly understand why products work or don't work
              for your hair type, and you'll spend far less money on boatloads of products that simply don't
              work. So what <strong>IS</strong> hair porosity? Well hair porosity refers to how well your hair
              absorbs and retains moisture. This is decided by the cuticle of your hair which decides which
              determines how easily moisture passes in and out of your hair strands. You have three main types
              of porosity. There is: </p><ul>
                <li>High porosity - your hair very easily absorbs and retains moisture, but also very easily loses moisture</li>
                <li>Normal Porosity - the rate at which your absorbs and retains moisture is moderate</li>
                <li>Low Porosity - your hair doesn't easily allow moisture to be absorbed in your hair shaft</li>
            </ul>
            <p class = "p2">
            A simple way to test your porosity is to drop a dry strand of hair into a glass of water, if it sinks rapidly,
            you have high porosity hair, if it floats at the top, you have low porosity hair and if it steadily floats from the top
            to the bottom, your hair is considered normal porosity. Find out your porosity now, and we'll talk more next week. See ya!

            <h2 class = "head2">The Grand Debate on Hair Types</h2>
            <h4 class = "date2">September 23, 2020 by Samara Soares</h4>
         </br></br>
            <img class = "wrap2" src = "hairtype.jpg" alt = "Pictures of different hair types" height = "200px" width = "200px"/>
            <p class = "p3">There is a large debate in the natural hair community around if hair types
                are accurate and if "hair typing" should actually be a thing. It's up to you to decide
                whether you agree or disagree with the practice, but for me, I think it's neither here nor there.
                Hair Type does not matter, as you and someone can have virtually the same hair <strong> TYPE </strong>
                but find that products that work for you won't work for them and vice versa. It may be an easier way
                to categorize black women, but it's definetely not accurate, since many persons have many different
                curl patterns displayed through their hair. Nonetheless, there are 4 different hair types, 1,2,3 and 4,
                and within those different groups, you can be A through to C. eg: 4A, 3B, 2A. Types 1 and 2 are generally straighter
                hair, with extremely loose curl patterns, while types 3 and 4 have tighter curl patterns and more pronounced curl
                definition. Do some research and let me know, what's your hair type?
